Write novels, short stories, and serial fiction with AI that maintains your voice, tracks your continuity, and gets better the more you use it. From first brainstorm to polished draft — specialized agents handle each mode of work (writing, critiquing, revising, exploring) while shared skills carry the craft methodology.

**What you get:**
- **Brainstorm without committing** — explore plot options, character arcs, and world mechanics with multiple AI perspectives before deciding anything
- **Write in your voice** — create style files from your existing prose, then draft new scenes that match
- **Catch your own mistakes** — structured critique, continuity checks, and simulated reader reactions
- **Keep everything in sync** — knowledge base updates as your story evolves

## Quick Start

```bash
meridian mars add haowjy/creative-writing-skills
meridian mars sync
meridian bootstrap
```

## Installation

### Mars (Meridian)

```bash
meridian mars add haowjy/creative-writing-skills
meridian mars sync
```

Then run `meridian` to start a session with muse. First-time setup runs the bootstrap automatically.

### Claude Code / Cowork

Claude Code and Cowork use the same plugin format.

**Claude Code** — add the marketplace and install:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add haowjy/creative-writing-skills
/plugin install creative-writing-skills@cw
```

**Cowork** — open the Claude Desktop app, go to Customize → "+" → Create plugin → enter `haowjy/creative-writing-skills` or upload from a local clone.

Once installed, start a session with muse as your agent:

```bash
claude --agent creative-writing-skills:muse
```

Run the one-time project setup to create your `CLAUDE.md` and `kb/` structure:

```
/creative-writing-skills:project-setup
```

### Claude.ai (Skills Only)

Claude.ai supports skills but not agents — you get the craft methodology without multi-agent orchestration.

1. Clone this repo and run `python scripts/create_skill_zips.py` to generate `.skill` files in `zips/`
2. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → Customize → Skills → "+" → Upload skill
3. Upload each `.skill` file

Recommended starting set: **writing-principles**, **prose-writing**, **scene-construction**, **prose-critique**.

## How It Works

```mermaid

    You([You]) --> M[muse]

    M --> Explore
    M --> Draft
    M --> Maintain

    subgraph Explore ["Explore & Plan"]
        direction LR
        B[brainstormer] ~~~ CS[character-sim]
        CS ~~~ O[outliner]
    end

    subgraph Draft ["Draft & Revise"]
        direction TB
        W[writer] --> CR[critic]
        CR -->|synthesis| RW[revision-writer]
        RW -.->|iterate| CR
        M -.->|pivotal scenes| RS[reader-sim]
        M -.->|voice check| CC[continuity-checker]
    end

    subgraph Maintain ["Knowledge"]
        direction LR
        CH[chronicler]
        SC[style-creator]
    end

    Explore -->|direction confirmed| Draft
    Draft -->|decisions & facts| Maintain
    Maintain -.->|context for next session| Explore
```

**Explore:** Fan out brainstormers for creative variety. Spawn character-sims to discover voices. Use outliners to shape structure once a direction is chosen.

**Draft & Revise:** Muse runs the write/critique/revise loop — writer produces prose, critics evaluate across the four reward channels (transportation, aesthetic, social simulation, flow), revision-writer fixes specific issues. Reader-sim gives experiential signal on pivotal scenes.

**Knowledge:** Chronicler extracts facts from completed chapters into the kb. Style-creator captures voice patterns from prose samples. The kb grows as the project evolves, giving every future agent accurate context.

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| **muse** | Author's creative partner — intent capture, brainstorming, drafting loops, knowledge maintenance |
| **writer** | Generative prose from scene briefs in the project's voice |
| **revision-writer** | Surgical revision from critique — preserves voice, fixes specific issues |
| **bridge-writer** | Transitions, time compression, connective passages between pivotal scenes |
| **critic** | Adversarial critique across the four reader reward channels |
| **reader-sim** | Simulates a reader's experience, reports moment-by-moment |
| **character-sim** | In-character voice performance for discovery and relationship testing |
| **continuity-checker** | Checks drafts against established canon |
| **brainstormer** | Wide-open option generation on a scoped question |
| **outliner** | Structural decomposition into beat sheets and arc maps |
| **style-creator** | Analyzes existing prose to create style reference files |
| **chronicler** | Extracts story facts from chapters into the kb |

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **writing-principles** | Four reward channels, AI failure modes, reader psychology |
| **prose-writing** | Immersion patterns — psychic distance, rhythm, sensory grounding, interiority |
| **scene-construction** | Beat-level craft — scene entry, dialogue, pacing, transitions |
| **prose-critique** | Adversarial reading methodology with focus areas |
| **style-analysis** | How to analyze prose and produce style reference files |
| **story-architecture** | Arc shape, tension curves, structural analysis |
| **story-context** | Context scoping — what to pass to each agent type |
| **brainstorming** | Exploratory capture with source tagging |
| **kb-management** | Maintaining the story knowledge base — page conventions, organization, when to create vs update |
| **writing-artifacts** | File conventions — kb/ for durable knowledge, work/ for scratch |
| **writing-issues** | Issue tracking across revision cycles |
| **writing-staffing** | Team composition — which agents, how many, what focus areas |
| **project-setup** | One-time guided setup — interviews about the project, creates CLAUDE.md and kb structure |

## Compatibility

| Feature | Claude Code | Cowork | Mars (Meridian) | Claude.ai |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| All agents | Yes (flat) | Yes (flat) | Yes (hierarchical) | No |
| All skills | Yes | Yes | Yes | Upload as zip |
| Multi-agent orchestration | Via muse | Via muse | Via muse → bard → workers | No |
| Project setup | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

Claude Code and Cowork use the same plugin format with all agents as flat subagents under muse. The Meridian version adds intermediate orchestrators (bard for drafting, lore-keeper for knowledge maintenance) for deeper context isolation. Claude.ai supports skills only — upload individual skill zips for craft methodology without orchestration.

## Current Experiments

**Rhetorical questions in skill prompts.** The economy section in `writing-principles` uses rhetorical questions ("what can you leave out and still have the scene work?") rather than declarative statements. LLMs can distinguish rhetorical from information-seeking questions internally ([arxiv 2604.14128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.14128)), and Self-Ask prompting shows questions improve reasoning — but no research directly tests whether rhetorical questions in system prompts improve task performance vs. equivalent declaratives. Keeping the rhetorical form to see if it activates a self-check loop that declaratives don't.

## Development
