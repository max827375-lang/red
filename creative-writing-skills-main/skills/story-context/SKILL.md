description: Context scoping for writing agent spawns — use when deciding what context a spawned agent should receive, whether ephemeral story decisions should be materialized before handoff, and how much to pass. Poor context handoffs cause writers to invent contradictions and critics to miss relevant history.

# Story Context

Every spawn starts with a context decision. Get it wrong and the writer invents facts that contradict established canon, the critic misses a continuity issue because it never saw the relevant chapter, or the brainstormer explores territory the author already rejected.

The `/meridian-spawn` skill teaches the mechanics of `-f`, `--from`, and spawn commands. This skill teaches the judgment — what story context to pass, when to materialize decisions before spawning, and how much is enough.

## Choose the Right Mechanism

Three options, each for a different situation. `/meridian-spawn` has the
command syntax; this section covers when to use which.

**Files (`-f`)** — when context already exists as files: chapters, outlines,
wiki pages, style files, character state. Default choice because files are
stable, inspectable, and survive compaction. Scope tightly — pass the files
that matter, not everything.

**Session history (`--from`)** — when the agent needs decisions, reasoning, or
brainstorm context that hasn't been written down yet. Session history captures
the *why* behind choices — why the author picked this angle, what they rejected.

**Materialize first** — when context is too important to be ephemeral. If
critical story decisions only live in conversation, write them to the kb or
work directory *before* spawning. If a writer could accidentally contradict
this context, materialize it. If it's supplementary background, `--from` is
fine.

## What Each Agent Needs

### Writers

Writers need enough to stay in voice and on-canon, not everything ever written. The essential context:

- **Scene brief or outline** — what happens in this scene, the beats to hit
- **Relevant style files** — look at what exists in the styles directory and pick the files that match the scene. Character files for whoever appears, scene-type files for the kind of scene being written. Each style file is self-describing — read the top to know when it applies.
- **Continuity anchors** — the immediately preceding chapter or scene (for flow), plus any chapters that establish facts this scene references. Two to four files, not the entire manuscript.
- **Character state** — character files for characters who appear in the scene, especially if their emotional state or knowledge has changed recently

Tell the writer where to find more if it needs to explore — "the full arc outline is in the work directory, focus on the Route 1 section" — rather than attaching everything preemptively.

### Critics

Critics need the draft plus enough context to judge it against:

- **The draft being reviewed** — always via `-f`
- **The scene brief or outline** — so the critic can check whether the draft achieved what it was supposed to
- **Relevant style files** — so voice critics can compare against the target voice
- **Prior chapters for continuity** — so continuity critics can cross-reference facts
- **Author intent** — via `--from` if the orchestrator discussed direction with the author, or via materialized decision notes
- **Known issues** — tracked issues if the critic should watch for specific recurring problems

### Brainstormers

Brainstormers need constraints, not answers:

- **The question being explored** — scoped tightly in the prompt
- **Established context that constrains the answer** — character profiles, timeline, prior decisions that limit the design space
- **What's been rejected** — so they don't re-propose dead ends

Don't pass too much — brainstormers that receive the full project history tend to produce conservative ideas that fit neatly into existing patterns instead of exploring fresh territory.

### Knowledge Maintenance

- **Chronicler**: the chapter(s) to extract facts from via `-f`, plus existing canon files and timeline entries for deduplication
- **Base @kb-maintainer**: the kb directory structure — it needs to see everything to rebuild connections
- **Base @kb-writer**: `--from` pointing at the conversation to mine, plus kb paths for where to write findings

## Cross-Phase Context

Carry forward what a previous phase learned using `--from <prior-spawn-id>`.
The revision writer benefits from seeing what the first-draft writer
discovered. The critic benefits from seeing prior critique rounds.

Combine mechanisms when phases produce artifacts: `--from` for reasoning
context, `-f` for the files the prior phase created.
